## My projects

### [Fruity Pie](https://github.com/mmoomocow/Grandmas-fruit)
Fruity Pie is a game I developed with 3 others for the Dunedin High School game jam in 2022. It is based around a monkey who steals Grandma's fruit bucket and has retreated to the top of a tree. You play as the grandson who must catch the fruit so Grandma can bake her pie. Also see the [ODT article](https://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/pie-sky-dream-realised-game-jam) about the event and the game we developed. I plan to keep developing the game and polishing it further.

The true game jam release of the game can be found under [Releases -> v1.0.0](https://github.com/mmoomocow/Grandmas-fruit/releases/tag/v1.0.0).

### [Expedition](https://github.com/mmoomocow/expedition)
Expedition was developed as part of the cross pacific game jam 2023 between dunedin and tokyo. I worked in a pair to develop this game. The theme was `Explore! Escape?` and we wanted to focus on having a place to explore, and the `?` on the escape. You play as a person who has just landed on a planet that is too toxic to live on and have to explore. You find a mysterious man who isn't happy and gives you 90 seconds to escape, but do you need to?

The game jam release of the game is found under [Releases -> v1.0.0](https://github.com/mmoomocow/expedition/releases/tag/v1.0.0).
